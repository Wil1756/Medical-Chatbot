In either case, this \\nbook provides a clear, simple, visual guide to help you pinpoint the problem and \\nmake an informed decision about what to do.\\nThe series of head-to-toe diagnostic guides provides a quick, easy way to check \\nout your symptoms and enables you to identify what the problem might be. It \\nmay also help you to decide when to see a doctor and how seriously to take \\ncertain symptoms so that you don’t delay when something is potentially urgent \\nor life-threatening. \\nNot only does the book tell you what the problem might be, it goes on to explain \\nmore about the condition and what it might mean for you.\\nHowever, a book can only give general guidance and is no substitute for \\nprofessional advice.

Part 1 deals with \\ngeneral complaints, where the symptoms cannot be \\npinpointed to any particular part of the body. Part 2 \\nis a series of head-to-toe visual diagnostic guides \\nthat help to identify conditions or injuries where \\nsymptoms occur in specific areas of the body. A cross-\\nreference links to an easy-to-follow description of the \\ncondition in Part 3. \\nAll conditions are given a rating to suggest the \\nurgency with which treatment should be sought. \\nPotentially life-threatening situations and ailments \\nthat need urgent medical advice are clearly flagged. \\nSymptoms usually resolve without specific treatment. \\nText may state to seek medical advice if condition persists, \\nor in particular groups, such as children.\\nSee a doctor (or dentist, if appropriate) for advice, \\ndiagnosis, and potential treatment within a few days. Text \\nwill say if medical attention is needed sooner. \\nGet medical attention or advice as soon as \\npossible, either by telephone or by visiting the emergency \\ndepartment. Additional text will tell you if the condition \\nis a medical emergency.\\nSeek urgent medical attention if you or the person \\naffected has the symptoms listed. These usually need \\nimmediate treatment and may be life-threatening.\\nKEY TO SYMBOLS\\nA series of symbols indicate whether medical advice \\nis needed and how speedily this should be sought.\\n22\\nWHOLE-BODY SYMPTOM GUIDE\\nNAUSEA AND VOMITING\\n 23\\n22\\n22\\n22\\n22\\nNAUSEA \\nAND\\n VOMITING\\nMigraine \\n(p.166)  \\nOften one-sided headache, with blurred \\nvision and flashing lights. \\nMeningitis \\n(p.168)  \\nRash, fever, headache, stiff neck, and general \\nunwellness.

Sometimes it is accompanied \\nby diarrhea. Vomiting may also be a sign of early \\ndiabetes (\\np.219\\n) or, very rarely, a brain tumor \\n(\\np.168\\n). If a child is vomiting, you should seek \\nurgent medical advice.\\nWITH HEADACHE\\nWITH ABDOMINAL PAIN\\nWITH DIARRHEA\\nWITH BLOOD IN URINE\\nWITH DIZZINESS\\nWITH DIZZINESS\\nNausea is the sensation of wanting to vomit, and it can occur \\nwithout actually vomiting. Vomiting can lead to dehydration, \\nlistlessness, confusion, and even coma. Some of the causes \\nof vomiting and nausea are gut-related, such as gastroenteritis \\n(p.196).

Most headaches are tension-type \\nheadaches, due to tightening of the \\nmuscles in the face, head, and neck. \\nOther types include migraines (below) \\nand cluster headaches (right). \\nCommon causes of headaches include \\nhangovers, stress, changes in sleep or \\neating habits, or poor posture. Food \\nadditives may be a cause in susceptible \\npeople. Headaches can also result from \\noverusing pain relievers (called \\nmedication-overuse headaches), or from \\nBrain during a migraine attack\\nThis brain scan shows the different levels \\nof activity during a migraine: red and \\nyellow indicate high activity; green and \\nblue are areas of low activity.\\nSkull fracture\\nThis colored X-ray shows a fracture at the \\nback of the skull. Injuries such as this can \\ncause brain damage and, if severe, may \\nbe fatal.\\nPartial seizure\\nThe abnormal activity originates in one part \\nof the brain. Usually, it remains confined to \\nthis area (upper diagram), but may sometimes \\nspread and become generalized (lower diagram).\\nGeneralized seizure\\nAbnormal activity spreads throughout the brain. \\nSymptoms vary, but typically include uncontrolled \\nmovements of the whole body, with loss of \\nconsciousness lasting up to several minutes.\\nCLUSTER HEADACHES\\nCluster headaches are excruciating \\nattacks of pain around one eye or temple, \\ndue to widening of blood vessels in the \\nbrain. Attacks begin suddenly, affect \\nonly one side of the head, and may be \\naccompanied by watering of the eye, \\ndrooping of the eyelid, and a stuffy \\nor runny nostril. Individual episodes \\nmay last from minutes to hours and \\nmay occur several times a day. Attacks \\nhappen in clusters, with periods when \\nattacks occur, typically every day for \\nweeks, followed by attack-free periods, \\nwhich may last months or years, before \\nattacks recur. \\nThe condition may be treated with \\nmedication, by breathing pure oxygen, or \\nby nerve stimulation (using a hand-held \\ndevice to stimulate a nerve in the neck).\\nCHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME\\nAlso sometime known as myalgic \\nencephalomyelitis (ME), chronic fatigue \\nsyndrome is a condition that causes \\nextreme fatigue over a prolonged period. \\nThe cause is unknown, although it \\nsometimes develops after an infection \\nor psychological trauma. The main \\nsymptom is persistent, overwhelming \\ntiredness. Other symptoms may include \\ndifficulty concentrating, poor short-term \\nmemory, muscle or joint pain, headaches, \\nand sleeping problems. \\nThe syndrome is also often associated \\nwith anxiety or depression. The severity \\nof symptoms can vary from day to day, \\nor even during the same day. There is \\nno specific treatment for this condition, \\nbut options that may be offered include \\ncognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), graded \\nexercise therapy, or medication \\nto relieve symptoms. Chronic fatigue \\nsyndrome is a long-term condition, but \\nit may clear up after several years.\\nMIGRAINE\\nA migraine is a recurrent, often severe \\nheadache that usually occurs on one side \\nof the head and may be accompanied by \\nsymptoms such as nausea and visual \\nEPILEPSY\\nEpilepsy is typified by recurrent seizures \\n(“fits”) as a result of abnormal electrical \\nactivity in the brain. In many people, the \\nunderlying cause is unknown. In other cases, \\nepilepsy results from disease or damage to \\nthe brain. In people with epilepsy, seizures \\nmay be triggered by things such as flashing \\nlights, stress, or lack of sleep.  \\nThere are various forms of epileptic \\nseizure. Partial seizures involve only one \\nside of the brain. Simple partial seizures, \\nconfined to a small area, produce \\nsymptoms such as twitching of one part \\nof the body and abnormal sensations. \\nComplex partial seizures produce loss of \\nawareness and strange behavior or body \\nmovements. Generalized seizures affect \\nmost or all of the brain. They typically \\ncause loss of consciousness, collapse, and \\nmuscle spasms, followed by a period of \\naltered consciousness and tiredness. Many \\nNARCOLEPSY\\nNarcolepsy is characterized by persistent \\ndaytime sleepiness, with repeated \\nepisodes of sleep throughout the day, \\neven at inappropriate times, such as \\nwhile eating. Attacks may last from a few \\nminutes to more than an hour. Other \\nsymptoms may include the inability to \\nmove while falling asleep or waking up \\n(called sleep paralysis), hallucinations \\nHEAD INJURY \\nMany bumps and bruises to the head are \\nminor, but a severe injury carries the risk \\nof brain damage and may even be fatal. \\nA blow to the head may shake or bruise \\nthe brain, and if the skull is fractured, \\nmaterial may enter the brain and cause \\ninfection. A blow or penetrating injury may \\ncause swelling of the brain or bleeding in \\nor around the brain. \\nIf a head injury is minor, there may only \\nbe a headache, or sometimes a concussion \\n(brief unconsciousness due to disturbance \\nof brain function). A more severe injury \\nmay result in significant brain damage, \\nprolonged unconsciousness or coma, and \\nmay potentially be fatal. After a severe \\ninjury, there may be muscular weakness or \\nparalysis and loss of sensation. There may \\nalso be memory loss (amnesia). A serious \\nhead injury may require surgery and may \\nresult in long-term disability.\\nbefore falling asleep, and the temporary \\nloss of muscle strength (cataplexy), causing \\nthe person to fall down. \\nIn many cases, narcolepsy is due to the \\nlack of a brain chemical that regulates \\nsleep, possibly as a result of an immune \\nsystem problem. Treatment of narcolepsy \\ninvolves regular naps and medication.\\nNERVOUS DISORDERS\\nconditions such as an inflammation of the \\nsinuses (sinusitis, p.191), toothache, arthritis \\naffecting the neck (cervical spondylosis, \\np.158), and head injury. Among the rare \\ncauses are inflammation of the membranes \\naround the brain (meningitis, p.168), \\nhigh blood pressure, a brain tumor, \\ninflammation of blood vessels in the head \\n(giant cell arteritis), or a ballooning of a \\nblood vessel in the brain (brain aneurysm).\\nMost headaches do not need medical \\ntreatment. However, if a headache is \\nsevere, lasts for more than 24 hours, or is \\naccompanied by other symptoms such as \\ndrowsiness, vomiting, a rash, or abnormal \\nsensitivity to light, immediate medical help \\nshould be sought.\\nSite of \\nseizure\\nPartial \\nseizure\\nSecondarily \\ngeneralized \\nseizure\\nSite of \\nseizure\\ndisturbances. The underlying cause is \\nunknown, but it is thought to be due to \\nabnormal brain activity, changes in brain \\nchemicals, and changes in the brain’s \\nblood vessels. Various factors may trigger \\nan attack, including stress, tiredness, low \\nblood sugar, dehydration, bright or \\nflickering lights, caffeine, alcohol, the food \\nadditive tyramine, or particular foods, \\nsuch as cheese or chocolate. Menstruation, \\nthe combined oral contraceptive pill, or \\nhormone replacement therapy may also \\ntrigger an attack. \\nThere are two main types of migraines: \\nwith aura and without aura. In migraines \\nwithout aura, there is a headache, usually \\non one side of the head and typically \\naccompanied by nausea, vomiting, and \\nsensitivity to light and noise. Migraines \\nwith aura causes similar symptoms, but \\nthe headache is preceded by warning \\nsigns (the aura), such as flashing lights or \\nnumbness on one side of the body. Some \\npeople also have very early signs (known \\nas a prodrome), such as mood or appetite \\nchanges, before the aura or headache \\nbegins. A migraine can usually be controlled \\nby avoiding triggers, and by medication to \\nprevent or limit attacks or relieve symptoms.\\nArea of low \\nbrain activity\\nFractured area \\nof skull\\npeople also have a warning “aura,” with \\nabnormal sensations just before a seizure. \\nA type of generalized seizure called an \\nabsence seizure produces short periods of \\naltered consciousness, but there are no \\nabnormal body movements.\\nEpilepsy can usually be controlled with \\nmedication. Occasionally, a seizure may \\nbe very prolonged, or repeated seizures \\nmay occur without a break. Known as \\nstatus epilepticus, this requires urgent \\nmedical attention.\\nArea of high \\nbrain activity\\nMIGRAINE\\nA migraine is a recurrent, often severe \\nheadache that usually occurs on one side \\nof the head and may be accompanied by \\nsymptoms such as nausea and visual \\nHEADACHE\\nMedication-overuse headache  |   \\nTension-type headache'),\n",

Around the layer of cancellous \\nbone is a layer of hard (cortical) bone, which is \\ncovered by a membrane called the periosteum.\\nBone in osteoporosis\\nIn osteoporosis, the medullary canal is \\nenlarged and the spongy and cortical bone \\nbecome less dense. The result is a loss of \\nbone mass and increased brittleness and \\nfragility of the bone.\\nOSTEOPOROSIS\\nIn osteoporosis, there is loss of bone tissue, \\nmaking the bones thinner and weaker. It is \\na natural part of aging, but women are \\nespecially vulnerable after menopause \\nbecause their ovaries no longer produce \\nestrogen, which helps to maintain bone \\nmass. Other risk factors for developing \\nosteoporosis include a diet low in calcium; \\ndisorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, \\nhyperthyroidism, and chronic kidney \\ndisease; long-term corticosteroid treatment; \\nprolonged immobility; and smoking. \\nThe first sign of osteoporosis is typically \\na fracture, often at the wrist or top of the \\nthigh bone near the hip joint. Sometimes, \\none or more vertebrae may fracture and \\ncrumble, leading to pain and progressive \\nloss of height.\\nTreatment is with calcium and vitamin \\nD supplements, regular exercise to build \\nup and maintain bone strength, and \\nmedication to help prevent bone loss and \\nreduce the risk of fractures. Hormone \\nreplacement therapy may also be suggested \\nfor some postmenopausal women, but it is \\nnot generally recommended because of \\nthe increased risk of adverse effects from \\nlong-term use, such as breast cancer.\\nOSTEOMYELITIS\\nOsteomyelitis is infection of a bone, \\nusually due to injury, surgery, or the spread \\nof infection from elsewhere in the body. \\nOften, the infection is with \\nStaphylococcus \\naureus\\n bacteria; other possible causes \\ninclude tuberculosis and fungal infection. \\nIn acute osteomyelitis, symptoms \\ndevelop suddenly and may include fever \\nand severe pain in the affected bone. In \\nchronic osteomyelitis, symptoms develop \\ngradually and may include mild fever and \\npersistent pain in the affected bone.\\nTreatment is with antibiotics or antifungal \\ndrugs. Surgery to remove the affected area \\nof bone may also be necessary.\\nSPONDYLOLYSIS\\nSpondylolysis is a disorder of the spine \\nin which part of the fifth (or, rarely, the \\nfourth) lumbar vertebra in the lower \\nback consists of soft, fibrous tissue \\ninstead of normal bone. As a result, the \\naffected vertebra is weak and vulnerable to \\ndamage under stress, which may produce \\nspondylolisthesis (forward slippage of the \\nvertebra over the one below it, p.158). \\nIf spondylolisthesis does occur, it may \\nproduce symptoms such as pain and \\nstiffness and require treatment. Otherwise, \\nspondylolysis usually produces no \\nsymptoms and treatment is not needed.\\nAVASCULAR NECROSIS\\nAvascular necrosis is death of part of \\na bone due to disruption of its blood \\nsupply, usually as a result of an injury \\nto the bone, such as a fracture. It most \\ncommonly affects the shoulder, hip, or \\nknee. It may not produce any obvious \\nsymptoms in the early stages, but later \\nthere is often persistent, gradually \\nworsening pain in the affected area.  \\nTreatment of avascular necrosis \\ndepends on the amount of bone \\ndamage, but may include medication, \\nor, if there is extensive damage to the \\nbone, surgery, such as a bone graft \\nor joint replacement. \\nPeriosteum (outer \\nmembrane)\\nHard (cortical) bone \\nbecomes less dense\\nSpongy \\n(cancellous) \\nbone \\nbecomes \\nless dense\\nEnlarged \\nmedullary canal\\nMedullary \\ncanal\\nHard (cortical) \\nbone\\nSpongy \\n(cancellous) \\nbone'),\n",

Normally, \\nbone is continually broken down and \\nreplaced by strong, new bone, but in \\nPaget’s disease the new bone is weak. \\nThe cause of the disease is unknown.\\n The most common sites affected by this \\ncondition are the skull, spine, pelvis, and \\nlegs. Symptoms may include bone and \\njoint pain; bone deformities, such as bow \\nlegs; fractures after only a minor injury; \\nnumbness, tingling, or weakness in the \\naffected area; and hearing loss. There is \\nno cure for Paget’s disease, but medication \\ncan relieve symptoms.\\nOSGOOD-SCHLATTER \\nDISEASE\\nOsgood–Schlatter disease is painful \\nswelling of the bony prominence of the \\nshin (called the tibial tuberosity) just below \\nthe knee. It occurs most commonly in \\nteenagers who play a lot of sports and \\nis thought to be caused by excessive, \\nrepetitive pulling of the quadriceps \\nmuscle at the front of the thigh, which is \\ntransmitted to the tibial tuberosity. The \\npain is usually worse during physical \\nactivity and eases with rest. Usually, only \\none leg is affected.\\nTreatment is not usually needed, \\napart from rest and pain relievers, and the \\ncondition typically clears up within a few \\nweeks or months.\\nBONE SPURS\\nAlso known as osteophytes, bone spurs \\nare bony lumps that grow on bones, \\naround joints, or on the vertebrae (spinal \\nbones). Bone spurs often develop in \\nosteoarthritis (p.157), cervical spondylosis \\n(osteoarthritis of the neck, p.158), and \\nankylosing spondylitis (inflammation of \\nthe vertebrae, p.158). They commonly \\naffect the neck, shoulder, knee, lower \\nback, fingers, or toes. Heel spurs are \\noften caused by repeated damage to \\nfoot muscles and ligaments. They are \\ncommon in athletes.\\nBone spurs do not always cause \\nsymptoms. If they do, symptoms may \\ninclude pain; restricted movement; and \\ntingling, numbness, or weakness in the \\naffected area. \\nTreatment is usually with pain relievers; \\nif movement is restricted, physical therapy \\nmay be helpful. In severe cases, surgery \\nto remove the spur may be offered.\\nBONE CANCER\\nEwing’s sarcoma   \\nMalignant bone tumors may originate in \\nthe bone itself (primary bone cancer) or \\noccur as a result of cancer spreading from \\nelsewhere in the body (secondary, or \\nmetastatic, bone cancer). \\nThe main types of primary cancer are \\nknown medically as osteosarcoma, Ewing’s \\nsarcoma, and chondrosarcoma. Their \\ncause is unknown. Symptoms for all types \\nof bone cancer may include persistent, \\ngradually worsening bone pain; swelling \\nand inflammation over the affected area \\nof bone; fever; fatigue; and weight loss. \\nTreatment is usually with a combination \\nof surgery to remove the cancerous \\npart of the bone, chemotherapy, and \\nradiation therapy. Sometimes, amputation \\nis necessary. \\nSecondary bone cancer most commonly \\naffects the spine, pelvis, ribs, or skull. It is \\nmost often due to the spread of breast \\n(p.216), lung (p.195), prostate (p.212), \\nthyroid, or kidney cancer (p.209). The \\nmain symptom is gnawing bone pain. \\nCancer affecting the spine may also cause \\na collapse of the vertebrae, which may \\nlead to weakness or paralysis of a limb. \\nTreatment is directed primarily at the \\nunderlying primary cancer.\\nNONCANCEROUS \\nBONE TUMORS\\nOsteoid osteoma\\nNoncancerous bone tumors may affect \\nany bone, but are most common in the \\nlong bones of the limbs or the vertebrae, \\nor the bones of the hands. The main types \\nare osteoid osteomas, osteochondromas, \\nand chondrodermatitis. They usually \\ndevelop during childhood or adolescence. \\nTheir cause is unknown. \\nThe presence of a tumor normally \\ncauses no symptoms, although sometimes \\nthe affected bone may become enlarged \\nand deformed. Occasionally, a tumor \\nmay press on a nerve, causing tingling \\nor numbness. In some cases, movement \\nmay be restricted or painful if the tumor \\npresses on nearby tendons.\\nA noncancerous bone tumor that is not \\ncausing problems may just be monitored. \\nOne that is causing symptoms or growing \\nrapidly may be removed by surgery, often \\nfollowed by a bone graft to replace the \\nremoved section of bone.\"),\n",

There is also often \\nbleeding, which may sometimes be \\nsevere. Traumatic vertebrae (spinal) \\nfractures may also damage the spinal \\ncord or spinal nerves, which may lead \\nto paralysis of part of the body. \\nTreatment usually involves immobilizing \\nthe affected part in a cast until the bone \\nheals.

Kyphosis \\nis common in children and usually \\ncorrects itself as the child grows. In adults, \\nkyphosis is typically due to poor posture, \\nweakening of the vertebrae usually caused \\nby osteoporosis (p.154), or obesity. In \\nscoliosis, the spine is curved to the left or \\nright, most commonly in the chest area \\nor lower back region. It may cause leaning \\nto one side and sometimes back pain. \\nScoliosis usually starts in childhood or \\nadolescence and tends to become \\nprogressively worse until growth stops. \\nTreatment is similar for all types of spinal \\ncurvature. Mild cases can often be treated \\nwith pain relievers and physical therapy. \\nSevere cases may be treated with a spinal \\nbrace and surgery to straighten the spine.\\nFOOT DEFORMITIES\\nClub foot  |  Flatfeet  |  High arches\\nFlatfeet are normal in children until the \\nage of about 2 or 3 years, when the arch \\nstarts to develop. Sometimes this fails to \\nhappen, resulting in flatfeet (pes planus). \\nIn adults, flatfeet are due to fallen arches, \\nwhich sometimes occurs as a result of \\nweight gain. Flatfeet sometimes ache, \\nbut this can usually be alleviated by using \\narch supports. Rarely, corrective surgery \\nmay be advised. \\nHigh arches (pes cavus) may be an \\ninherited condition or may develop \\nas a result of a muscle or nerve disorder. \\nIt may sometimes cause foot pain, which \\ncan usually be relieved by using orthotic \\ninserts (special inserts that support the \\narches). In severe cases, corrective surgery \\nmay be advised.\\nClub foot (talipes) is an inward twisting \\nof one or both feet and is present from \\nbirth.

In most cases, it is due \\nto the rupture of an aneurysm—a swollen, \\nweakened area at the junction between two \\narteries in the brain. In some people, \\nbleeding is due to malformed blood \\nvessels. Either problem may be present \\nfrom birth. A subarachnoid hemorrhage \\nmay also occur spontaneously or after \\nunaccustomed exercise. \\nThe bleeding typically causes a sudden, \\nviolent headache, with vomiting, stiff neck, \\nand sensitivity to bright light. A person \\nwith these symptoms should seek urgent \\nmedical attention. These symptoms may \\nbe followed by confusion, seizures (“fits”), \\nunconsciousness, and coma. Treatment is \\nwith medication and surgery. However, full \\nrecovery does not always occur, and many \\ncases are fatal.\\nEXTRADURAL HEMATOMA\\nThis is a collection of clotted blood \\n(hematoma) between the skull and outer \\nsurface of one of the three membranes \\ncovering the brain. It is most commonly \\ncaused by a head injury that ruptures a \\nblood vessel. Typically, symptoms develop \\nwithin hours of the injury. They may include \\nheadache, vomiting, drowsiness, paralysis \\naffecting one side of the body, and seizures \\n(“fits”). Anyone with these symptoms \\nshould seek urgent medical advice. A \\nhematoma may occur after a person \\nbriefly loses consciousness at the time of \\nan injury and then loses consciousness \\nagain hours later. In a few cases, bleeding \\noccurs relatively slowly and symptoms \\nmay not develop for days. \\nTreatment is with surgery. With prompt \\ntreatment, many people make a good \\nrecovery, although there may be long-term \\nresidual problems, such as weakness. In \\nsevere cases, it may be fatal.\\nSubdural hematoma\\nThe hematoma (collection of clotted blood) \\nbetween the outer two meninges (dura mater and \\narachnoid) exerts pressure on the brain. The \\nhematoma may enlarge rapidly within hours or \\nmay take weeks or months to increase in size.\\nVascular dementia \\nIn this form, a series of transient ischemic attacks \\n(mini-strokes) over time leads to damage or death \\nof brain tissue in areas supplied by blocked blood \\nvessels. The disease becomes progressively worse \\nas more areas of the brain become affected.\\nSUBDURAL HEMATOMA\\nA subdural hematoma occurs when \\nthere is bleeding into the space between \\nthe outer two of the three membranes \\ncovering the brain. This produces a pocket \\nof clotted blood (a hematoma) that \\npresses on the brain. The bleeding may be \\nslow (chronic) or rapid (acute). Chronic \\nbleeding may result from an apparently \\ntrivial head injury, and it may take up to \\nseveral months before symptoms develop. \\nThese typically include headaches, gradual \\nconfusion, weakness, and a decline in \\nconsciousness. Rapid bleeding usually \\nfollows a severe head injury and typically \\ncauses rapid loss of consciousness. A \\nperson who develops any of these \\nsymptoms should seek urgent medical \\nattention. Treatment is usually with \\nsurgery. Many people make a good \\nrecovery, although some residual \\nsymptoms may persist. A large, severe \\nhematoma may be fatal.\\nDEMENTIA\\nAlzheimer’s disease\\nDementia is a condition in which there \\nis gradual, progressive deterioration in \\nmental function. It most commonly \\naffects older people and is usually \\ncaused by diseases of the brain \\nor blood vessels in the brain. \\nThe most common form is \\nAlzheimer’s disease, in which \\na series of transient ischemic \\nattacks (small strokes) over a \\nlong period of time leads to \\ndamage and death of brain \\ntissue. Another form is vascular \\ndementia, in which the blockage of \\nsmall blood vessels in the brain causes \\nnumerous small areas of brain damage. In \\ndementia with Lewy bodies, tiny nodules \\n(called Lewy bodies) collect in the brain \\nand impair brain function. Dementia can \\noccasionally occur in younger people \\nas a result of a brain injury or diseases such \\nas Parkinson’s disease.

It is \\ncaused by an abnormal gene, and if a \\nperson inherits the gene from either parent, \\nhe or she will develop the disorder. In most \\ncases, symptoms do not appear until age 35 \\nto 50. The condition usually progresses for \\nabout 10 to 25 years until the person \\neventually dies. There is no cure for the \\ncondition, but medication may relieve some \\nof the symptoms. Those at risk can be tested \\nto see if they have the abnormal gene.\\nPARKINSON’S DISEASE\\nParkinson’s disease is a progressive \\ndisorder that causes tremors (involuntary \\ntrembling movements, usually of the \\nhands), slow movement, and stiffness. It \\nresults from degeneration of cells in a part \\nof the brain that produces dopamine,  a \\nchemical that helps to fine-tune muscle \\nmovements. In Parkinson’s disease, the \\ncells produce much less dopamine, \\nresulting in impaired muscle control. \\nIn most people, there is no obvious cause \\nof the condition, although genetic factors \\nmay be involved in some cases. It can also \\nresult from an inflammation of the brain \\n(encephalitis) or from damage to the basal \\nganglia from drugs or repeated head \\ninjuries. The main symptoms are trembling \\nof one hand, arm, or leg, which may \\nprogress to affect limbs on the opposite \\nside; muscle stiffness, making it difficult to \\nbegin moving and making movements \\nslower; and problems with balance. Other \\nsymptoms may include a stooped posture, \\nshuffling walk, problems speaking, loss of \\nfacial expression, and difficulty swallowing. \\nSome people also develop dementia \\n(opposite) or depression (p.242).\\nTreatment may include supportive \\ntherapies, such as physical therapy, and \\nmedication to improve symptoms. In \\nsome cases, surgery may be an option.\\nMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\\nIn multiple sclerosis (MS), nerve cells in \\nthe brain and spinal cord become \\nprogressively damaged, causing problems \\nwith a wide range of body functions. \\nElectrical signals pass between the brain \\nand body along the nerves. Healthy nerves \\nare covered by a protective sheath of a \\nsubstance called myelin, which facilitates \\nthe passage of nerve signals. MS involves \\nprogressive destruction of the myelin \\nsheaths, disrupting the transmission of \\nsignals. MS is an autoimmune disease, in \\nwhich the body’s immune system attacks \\nthe myelin sheaths. The underlying cause \\nis unknown, although genetic and \\nenvironmental factors may play a role. \\nCAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME\\nIn this condition, nerves at the base of \\nthe spinal cord—the cauda equina, a \\n“spray” of nerves resembling a horse’s tail—\\nbecome compressed, causing symptoms \\nsuch as back pain, bowel and bladder \\nproblems, numbness, leg weakness, and \\nerectile dysfunction. The cause is usually \\na disc herniation (slipped disc, p.158), \\nbut cauda equina syndrome may also \\nsometimes be caused by infection, a spinal \\ninjury, or bone cancer. Urgent treatment is \\nusually with emergency surgery to relieve \\nthe pressure on the affected nerves.\\nAMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS\\nIn amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), \\nalso \\nknown as Lou Gehrig’s disease, \\nthere is \\nprogressive degeneration of motor nerves \\n(nerves that control movement) in the spinal \\ncord. The disorder also affects muscles: as the \\nmotor nerves lose the ability to stimulate \\nmuscle activity, the muscles weaken and \\nwaste away. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \\nusually begins after the age of about 50, \\nalthough rarely it may occur in childhood or \\nadolescence. The cause is unknown, although \\nin a few people there is a genetic susceptibility.\\nInitially, symptoms develop over a few \\nmonths, with weakness and wasting in \\nthe hands, arms, and legs. Other early \\nsymptoms of ALS may include twitching, \\nstiffness, muscle cramps, and sometimes \\nspeech problems. \\nAs the disease progresses, symptoms \\nworsen and cause problems with everyday \\nactivities, such as holding objects, climbing \\nstairs, and walking. Mental abilities are \\nusually not impaired, although control of \\nemotions may be affected and some people \\nbecome depressed. Eventually, the muscles \\nthat control breathing are affected and \\nbecome weakened, and the person dies. \\nThere is no cure for amyotrophic lateral \\nsclerosis, although treatment may relieve \\nsome of the symptoms and slow \\nprogression of the disease.\\nLate-stage MS \\nAs the disorder progresses, there is \\nincreasing damage to myelin sheaths, \\nand more nerves become affected. \\nNerve damage is irreversible.\\nEarly-stage MS\\nWhite blood cells (cells from the \\nimmune system) attack the myelin \\nsheaths on the nerves.

In general, they may include \\nnumbness, tingling, pain, loss of balance \\nand coordination, muscle weakness, blurred \\nvision, dizziness, bladder or bowel \\nproblems, and erectile dysfunction.\\nCARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is numbness, \\ntingling, and pain in the fingers and hand \\ndue to pressure on the median nerve in \\nthe wrist. The median nerve passes down \\nthe forearm to the hand, where it controls \\nmuscles at the base of the thumb and \\nsensation in the thumb half of the palm. \\nEn route to the hand, the nerve passes \\nthrough the carpal tunnel, a space \\nbetween the wrist bones and the ligament \\nthat lies over them; in addition to the \\nnerve, tendons pass through the space.\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome occurs when \\nthe nerve is compressed, which may be \\ndue to swelling of the tendons or a \\nbuild-up of fluid in the carpal tunnel as a \\nresult of overuse, arthritis, diabetes, or \\nthyroid problems. It can also occur with \\nhormonal changes during pregnancy or \\naround menopause. The pressure on the \\nnerve results in numbness, tingling, pain, \\nand loss of grip in the thumb, first two \\nfingers, and half of the ring (third) finger. \\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is usually \\ntreated with rest, splinting, or \\nmedication. Sometimes, surgery \\nis needed. \\nNEURALGIA\\nPostherpetic neuralgia \\nNeuralgia is pain caused by damage to, \\nor irritation of, a nerve. The pain usually \\noccurs in brief bouts and may be severe. \\nSome types of neuralgia are features of \\na specific disorder. In migraines (p.166), \\nthere may be a form that consists of \\nintense, radiating pain around one eye. \\nPostherpetic neuralgia is a burning pain \\nthat may occur at the site of an attack \\nof shingles (herpes zoster, p.233) for \\nmonths or even years after the illness. \\nOther types of neuralgia result from \\ndisturbance of a particular nerve. For \\nexample, in trigeminal neuralgia, pain \\naffects one side of the face supplied by \\nthe trigeminal nerve. Treatment for \\nneuralgia is usually with medication, \\nor sometimes surgery.\\nTRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA\\nTrigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, \\nexcruciating pain on one side of the face \\ndue to a disorder of the trigeminal nerve, \\nwhich provides sensation from parts of the \\nface and controls some muscles used for \\nchewing. The cause is usually pressure on \\nthe nerve from a blood vessel or, rarely, \\nfrom a tumor. Attacks may last for a few \\nseconds to several minutes, and may be \\nso severe that the person is unable to do \\nanything during them. Afterward, the pain \\nusually disappears completely. An attack \\nmay occur spontaneously, or may be \\ntriggered by actions such as chewing, \\ntalking, or touching the face. Attacks may \\nbe frequent, though in some cases there \\nmay be long periods of remission. \\nTreatment for this condition is usually \\nwith medication, although surgery may \\nsometimes be an option.\\nCOMPLEX REGIONAL \\nPAIN SYNDROME\\nFormerly known by various names, \\nincluding causalgia and reflex sympathetic \\ndystrophy, complex regional pain syndrome \\nis a condition in which there is long-lasting \\npain, usually in an arm or leg, but \\nsometimes affecting other areas of the \\nbody as well. It is most often triggered by \\nan injury, but the pain is more severe and \\nlong-lasting than would be expected from \\nthe severity of the injury. The skin over the \\npainful area may be red and tender, or \\nblue, cold, and clammy. It may be so \\nsensitive that even a light touch may \\nprovoke intense pain.\\nComplex regional pain syndrome may \\ndevelop after either a minor or more \\nserious injury, including fractures, sprains \\nor strains, burns, or cuts. However, it is \\nunknown why some people develop the \\ncondition after such injuries whereas \\nothers do not. \\nThere is no cure for complex regional \\npain syndrome, but symptoms may be \\ncontrolled with a combination of \\nmedication, psychological therapy, and \\nphysical rehabilitation.\\nMedian \\nnerve\\nTendon \\nsheath \\nTendon\\nCarpal \\nligament \\nCarpal tunnel\\nThe carpal tunnel is a narrow space formed by the \\nbones of the wrist and the carpal ligament over \\nthem.

At the ankle, the \\nnerve passes through the tarsal tunnel, \\na space formed by the ankle bones and \\nbands of supporting tissue. \\nTarsal tunnel syndrome occurs if the \\nspace is constricted and the nerve is \\ncompressed, commonly as a result of \\noveruse, injury, or arthritis. Tarsal tunnel \\nsyndrome is also more common in people \\nwith a condition known as flatfeet. \\nTreatment is with rest, medication, or \\nsometimes surgery.\\nCERVICAL RADICULOPATHY\\nPinched nerve\\nCommonly called a pinched nerve, cervical \\nradiculopathy is a condition that results \\nwhen a nerve in the neck is irritated or \\ncompressed where it branches away \\nfrom the spinal cord. It is mostly due to \\na ruptured disc in the neck region of the \\nspine, or a spur (bony outgrowth) on a \\nspinal vertebra. The condition usually \\naffects one side and typically causes \\npain that radiates from the neck to the \\nshoulder and arm; tingling in the fingers \\nand hand; muscle weakness in the \\nshoulder, arm, or hand; and numbness. \\nTreatment may include medication or, \\nin some cases, surgery.\\nFACIAL NERVE PALSY\\nFacial nerve palsy, also known as Bell’s \\npalsy, is weakness of the facial muscles due \\nto damage or inflammation of the facial \\nnerve, which controls certain muscles in \\nthe face. It affects only one side of the face, \\ncausing an eyelid and the corner of the \\nmouth to droop. There may also be other \\nsymptoms, such as earache, increased \\nsensitivity to sound, and an altered sense \\nof taste. The cause is often unknown, but \\nsometimes palsy may be due to damage to \\nthe nerve caused by a tumor or surgery, or \\nthe palsy may be associated with a viral \\ninfection. Facial nerve palsy may be treated \\nwith medication or, if the palsy is due to \\ndamage, with surgery.\\nMERALGIA PARESTHETICA\\nIn meralgia paresthetica, there are \\nabnormal sensations, such as burning \\npain, numbness, and tingling in the \\nouter thigh. Symptoms are often made \\nworse by standing or walking. The \\ncondition is due to a specific nerve being \\ntrapped under a ligament in the groin. \\nIn many cases, the cause is unknown, \\nalthough sometimes it can result from \\ninjury or overuse. It can also be associated \\nwith pregnancy and obesity. \\nTreatment for this condition is with rest \\nand medication, or rarely surgery.\\nMORTON’S NEUROMA\\nIn this condition, a nerve between the toe \\nbones becomes irritated and thickened. \\nUsually, the nerve affected is between the \\nthird and fourth toes, but sometimes the \\nnerve between the second and third toes \\ncan be the cause. The condition typically \\ncauses a tingling sensation between the \\ntoes, and pain in the ball of the foot or \\nbase of the toes. The pain is often worse \\nwhen walking or wearing tight shoes. \\nWearing wider shoes, rest, and pain \\nrelievers may relieve symptoms. Surgery \\nmay be advised to treat severe cases.\\nCourse of the sciatic nerve\\nThe sciatic nerve is formed where nerves from \\nthe lower spinal cord combine to form one large \\nnerve. The nerve and its branches extend along \\nthe length of the leg and into the ankle and foot.\\nSCIATICA\\nSciatica is nerve pain caused by pressure \\non or damage to the sciatic nerve, which \\nruns from the base of the spinal cord down \\nthe legs and into the feet. The pain usually \\naffects only one side, and most commonly \\noccurs in the buttock or thigh, although \\nit may extend down to the foot.

It is sometimes \\ncalled “swimmer’s ear,” because persistent \\nmoisture in the ear increases the risk of \\ninfection. The condition may also occur \\nas part of a general skin disorder, such as \\neczema (p.222).\\nSymptoms of otitis externa include \\nswelling, discharge of pus from the ear, \\nitchiness or pain in the ear canal, and \\nsometimes temporary hearing loss. Often \\nthe only treatment needed is to keep the \\near clean and dry until the infection clears \\nup. If it persists or is severe, medication to \\ntreat the infection and relieve symptoms \\nmay be prescribed.\\nEARWAX\\nAlso called cerumen, earwax is produced \\nby glands in the outer ear canal to clean \\nand moisten the canal. Normally, the wax \\nemerges naturally, but sometimes it builds \\nup and causes a blockage, producing a \\nfeeling of fullness in the ear and impairing \\nhearing. Wax blockage can usually be \\ntreated with eardrops. Persistent blockage \\nmay need treatment to flush out the ears \\nor suck out the wax.\\nSENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS\\nSensorineural hearing loss is hearing loss \\ncaused by damage to sensory nerves in \\nthe ear or the nerve that carries auditory \\ninformation to the brain. It is usually due \\nto age or prolonged exposure to noise. \\nHowever, it may also sometimes be \\npresent at birth or result from various \\ndisorders. Sensorineural hearing loss is \\nusually permanent. Hearing aids may be \\nhelpful in some cases. With profound \\ndeafness, a cochlear implant may allow \\nhearing of sounds such as speech.\\nPRESBYCUSIS\\nA form of sensorineural deafness, \\npresbycusis is progressive loss of hearing \\nthat occurs with age. It is due to the \\nnatural degeneration and death of sensory \\nnerve cells in the ear. Both ears are usually \\naffected. The loss of hearing causes \\ndifficulty in hearing high-pitched sounds \\nand difficulty in hearing speech clearly, \\nespecially if there is background noise.\\nThere is no cure for presbycusis, but \\nin most cases hearing can be improved \\nwith hearing aids.\\nAURICULAR CHONDRITIS\\nAuricular chondritis is inflammation of \\nthe cartilage of the auricle (outer flap \\nof the ear), usually as a result of a bacterial \\ninfection after a cut to the outer ear or \\near piercing. The infection causes \\ninflammation, swelling, and pain in the \\nouter ear. Treatment with antibiotics \\nusually clears up the infection.\\nOTOSCLEROSIS\\nIn otosclerosis, there is abnormal growth \\nof bone around the stapes, one of the \\nthree tiny bones in the middle ear that \\ntransmit sounds to the inner ear. The \\nstapes gradually becomes immobilized, \\nresulting in progressive loss of hearing. \\nUsually both ears are affected. As well as \\nresulting in hearing loss, otosclerosis may \\nalso cause tinnitus (ringing in the ear).\\nIn many cases, hearing can be improved \\nthrough the use of a hearing aid. For \\nsevere cases, hearing can usually be \\nrestored by surgery to replace the stapes \\nwith an artificial substitute.\\nBAROTRAUMA\\nBarotrauma is damage or pain, mainly \\naffecting the middle ear, caused by changes \\nin pressure. Such changes are common \\nwhen flying or diving, and may cause minor \\ndamage to the middle ear, producing pain, a \\nfeeling of fullness in the ears, and tinnitus \\n(ringing in the ear).

Bacterial labyrinthitis usually \\nneeds treatment with antibiotics.\\nACOUSTIC NEUROMA\\nAn acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous \\ntumor of the acoustic nerve (also called \\nthe vestibulocochlear nerve), which carries \\nbalance and auditory signals from the ear \\nto the brain. Usually, only the nerve of one \\near is affected. In most cases, the cause is \\nunknown, although a minority are due to \\nthe genetic condition neurofibromatosis, \\nin which multiple tumors grow on nerves.\\nTINNITUS\\nTinnitus is the term for noises such as \\nbuzzing, ringing, or hissing that originate \\nwithin the ear rather than externally. It is \\ncommonly associated with hearing loss \\nand can also occur as a symptom of ear \\ndisorders, such as labyrinthitis, Ménière’s \\ndisease, otitis media (p.174), or earwax \\nblockage. It may also be caused by certain \\nmedications, such as aspirin. \\nTinnitus may improve if the underlying \\ncause can be treated.

It is due to a build-up of \\nfluid in the labyrinth, which contains the \\norgans of balance and hearing. Usually, \\nonly one ear is affected, but both can \\nbecome involved. Attacks typically come \\non suddenly and may last from minutes \\nto days before subsiding. \\nVESTIBULAR NEURITIS\\nAlso known as vestibular neuronitis, \\nvestibular neuritis is inflammation of \\nthe vestibular nerve in the inner ear, \\nusually as a result of a bacterial or viral \\ninfection, such as the common cold or \\ninfluenza. The main symptoms are \\ndizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and \\nblurred vision. Viral vestibular neuritis \\nusually clears up by itself within a few \\nweeks, although medication may help to \\nrelieve symptoms such as nausea and \\nvomiting. Bacterial vestibular neuritis \\nusually needs treatment with antibiotics.\\nSymptoms include vertigo, nausea, \\nvomiting, tinnitus, impaired hearing, and \\na feeling of pressure or pain in the ear. The \\ntime between attacks may vary from days \\nto years, and repeated attacks often lead \\nto progressive hearing loss or sometimes \\ntotal deafness.\\nTreatment is primarily with medication \\nto relieve symptoms, but in some cases \\ndrugs may be given to help reduce the \\nfrequency of attacks.

Repeated infections can scar the \\neyelids and make the eyelashes turn \\ninward so that they rub against the cornea, \\nleading to it becoming scarred and \\neventually resulting in blindness.\\nIn the early stages, trachoma can be \\ntreated with antibiotics. If the eyelashes have \\nturned inward, surgery may be needed to \\nstop them rubbing against the cornea.

Because \\nthe eyelids cannot close fully, the cornea \\nis exposed and vulnerable to damage or \\ninfection. Ectropion is usually due to aging, \\nbut may also be caused by damage to a \\nfacial nerve. Treatment is with surgery to \\ntighten the eyelid. \\nEntropion is a turning inward of the \\nupper or lower eyelid, or both. As a \\nresult, the eyelashes rub against the \\ncornea, causing pain, irritation, and eye \\nwatering. Constant rubbing may scar \\nthe cornea, leading to loss of vision. \\nEntropion is commonly due to aging, \\nbut may also be due to the eye infection \\ntrachoma (p.177). It can usually be \\ncorrected with surgery.\\nBLEPHARITIS\\nBlepharitis is inflammation of the eyelids, \\ncausing redness and itchiness, greasy scales \\nat the lid margins, and crusts on the \\neyelashes. It may be associated with skin \\ndisorders such as seborrheic dermatitis \\n(p.222), or with bacterial infection or \\nallergy.

Other causes include coronary \\nartery spasm, in which the blood vessels \\nnarrow suddenly for a short period of \\ntime, heart valve problems, and heart \\nrhythm disorders. Severe anemia, which \\nreduces the blood’s oxygen-carrying \\ncapacity, may also cause angina. \\nThe pain of angina usually starts in the \\ncenter of the chest but may spread to \\nthe neck, back, and arms, or between the \\nshoulder blades.

It \\nis usually caused by bacterial infection, \\noften as a result of blockage of a bile duct, \\nand typically causes upper abdominal \\npain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and \\njaundice. Treatment is with antibiotics and, \\nCIRRHOSIS\\nCirrhosis is scarring of the liver arising from \\nlong-term damage to its cells. As a result, \\nliver function becomes impaired, which may \\neventually lead to liver failure. The most \\ncommon causes of cirrhosis are long-term, \\nexcessive alcohol consumption and \\nlong-term infection with a hepatitis virus. \\nOther causes include nonalcoholic fatty \\nliver disease (NAFLD), disorders of the bile \\nducts (the tubes that carry bile from the \\nliver to the gallbladder and intestines), \\ncertain inherited disorders of body \\nchemistry, cystic fibrosis, heart failure, \\nand certain poisons or medications. \\nCirrhosis often produces no symptoms in \\nthe early stages. As the condition progresses, \\nLIVER FAILURE\\nIn liver failure, normal functioning of the \\nliver is severely impaired. It may occur \\nsuddenly (acute liver failure), for example, \\nas a result of acute hepatitis or toxins, or \\ngradually (chronic liver failure), which is \\ncommonly due to chronic hepatitis or \\ncirrhosis from long-term alcohol abuse. \\nSymptoms of acute failure develop rapidly \\nand may include confusion, drowsiness, \\nunconsciousness, and death. Chronic \\nfailure develops more slowly and may \\nproduce jaundice, itching, abdominal \\nswelling due to fluid build-up, and, in men, \\nenlarged breasts and shrunken testes.\\nAcute liver failure requires immediate \\nhospital treatment; it is often ultimately \\nfatal without a liver transplant. Chronic \\nliver failure is treated with medication to \\nrelieve symptoms, as well as lifestyle \\nmeasures, such as a diet low in salt and \\nprotein and stopping alcohol consumption.\\nthere may be tiredness, nausea, loss of \\nappetite, weight loss, jaundice, swelling of \\nthe legs or abdomen due to the build-up of \\nfluid, vomiting of blood, a tendency to bleed \\nor bruise easily, itchy skin, and black, tarry \\nfeces. Cirrhosis may also cause toxins to \\nbuild up in the brain, producing symptoms \\nsuch as confusion, difficulty concentrating, \\nand changes in personality; eventually, it \\nmay even lead to coma.\\nLiver damage due to cirrhosis is usually \\nirreversible. Treatment is directed toward \\nrelieving symptoms and slowing the rate \\nof liver damage, if possible, by treating \\nthe underlying cause. It is also important \\nto avoid alcohol. In some cases, however, \\nliver failure develops, and a liver transplant \\nis the only treatment option.\\nif necessary, surgery to clear any blockage. \\nPrimary biliary cholangitis is a long-term \\ncondition in which the bile ducts become \\ndamaged. It is thought to be due to the \\nimmune system mistakenly attacking the \\nducts. Symptoms include tiredness, itchy \\nskin, and bloating. \\nTreatment may include medication \\nto minimize liver damage and relieve \\nsymptoms. In severe cases, a liver \\ntransplant may be needed.'),\n",

An anal fistula may also \\nsometimes develop as a result of an \\nintestinal disorder such as Crohn’s \\ndisease (p.203), ulcerative colitis (p.203), \\nor colon cancer.\\nSymptoms of an anal fistula may \\ninclude a discharge of pus onto the skin \\naround the anus; passing blood or pus in \\nthe feces; irritation, swelling, redness, and \\nconstant, throbbing pain around the \\nanus; and, in some cases, fever and fecal \\nincontinence.\\nA fistula rarely heals by itself and usually \\nrequires treatment with surgery.\\nANAL CANCER\\nCancer of the anus or anal canal is rare \\nand its cause is unknown, although it \\nmay be linked with infection with human \\npapillomaviruses (HPV), which cause \\ngenital warts (p.218) and are also \\nassociated with cervical cancer (p.215).\\nSymptoms of anal cancer usually \\ndevelop gradually. They may include \\nbleeding from the anus, itching and pain \\naround the anus, a frequent need to \\ndefecate or fecal incontinence, a discharge \\nof mucus from the anus, and a lump in or \\nnear the anus.\\nThe usual treatment is chemotherapy \\ncombined with radiation therapy. In many \\ncases, this causes the tumor to shrink \\nso that surgery is not needed. However, \\nif this treatment is ineffective, surgery \\nto remove the anus and part of the \\nrectum is necessary.\\nANAL FISSURE\\nAn anal fissure is a tear or ulcer in the \\nlining of the anal canal. It is most commonly \\ncaused by damage from passing hard, dry \\nfeces due to constipation. It is also \\ncommon during pregnancy and after \\ndelivery. Less common causes include \\nan inflammatory bowel disease, such as \\nCrohn’s disease (p.203) or ulcerative colitis \\n(p.203), or having unusually tight anal \\nsphincter muscles.\\nThe main symptoms are severe pain \\nwhen defecating and bleeding when \\ndefecating (often visible as bright red blood \\non the feces, toilet paper, or in the toilet \\nbowl). Most fissures heal by themselves \\nwithin a few weeks. Measures such as a \\nhigh-fiber diet to prevent constipation and \\npain relievers can relieve symptoms and help \\nthe healing process. If such treatments are \\nineffective, surgery may be recommended.\\nRECTAL PROLAPSE\\nIn a rectal prolapse, the lining of the \\nrectum protrudes outside the anus. It is \\noften a result of increased pressure in the \\nabdomen due, for example, to constipation, \\npregnancy, or persistent coughing. The \\ncondition is more common in women and \\nolder people, and may be a recurrent \\nproblem in those who have weak pelvic \\nfloor muscles. Rectal prolapse also \\nsometimes occurs temporarily in young \\nchildren during toilet training.\\nThe main symptom is a lump protruding \\nout of the anus. Initially, this may appear \\nonly when straining to defecate and then \\nit disappears when standing up, but later \\nit may be present all the time. Other \\nsymptoms may include discomfort or \\npain when defecating, and bleeding and \\na discharge of mucus from the anus. If \\nthe prolapse is large, there may also be \\nfecal incontinence.\\nIn many cases, the prolapse can be \\ntreated by pushing it back, followed \\nby treatment to relieve the cause, such \\nas a high-fiber diet for constipation. \\nSometimes, however, surgery is needed \\nto fix the rectum in position permanently.\\nHEMORRHOIDS\\nCommonly known as piles, hemorrhoids \\nare swollen veins inside the rectum or \\naround the anus. They result from \\nincreased pressure inside the abdomen, \\ncommonly due to straining to defecate \\nbecause of constipation or diarrhea, excess \\nbody weight, or pregnancy. \\nHemorrhoids that occur inside the \\nrectum may bleed, showing as bright red \\nblood on the feces, toilet paper, or in the \\ntoilet bowl.

It can also be transmitted \\nfrom a mother to her baby during birth.  \\nGonorrhea often produces no \\nsymptoms. If symptoms do occur, in men \\nthey may include a discharge of pus from \\nthe penis and painful urination. In women, \\nthere may be a yellowish-green discharge of \\npus from the vagina, painful urination, and \\nirregular vaginal bleeding. Gonorrhea may \\nlead to pelvic inflammatory disease (p.213) \\nin women or inflammation of the prostate \\n(p.211) or bladder in men.

Type 1 is an autoimmune \\ndisorder in which the immune system \\ndestroys insulin-producing cells in the \\npancreas. The underlying cause is \\nunknown, but it may be triggered by \\na viral infection, and some people may \\nalso have a genetic predisposition to \\ndeveloping it.

The cause is \\nprobably a broken hair fragment growing \\ninward into the skin. \\nA pilonidal sinus is usually harmless, does \\nnot cause symptoms, and does not need \\ntreatment. However, it may become \\ninfected, which may result in a painful, \\nswollen, pus-filled abscess (called a pilonidal \\ncyst) that does need treatment. Treatment is \\nusually with antibiotics and surgery to drain \\nthe pus. If there are repeated infections, the \\nsinus may be surgically removed.\\nFUNGAL NAIL INFECTION\\nKnown medically as onychomycosis, fungal \\nnail infections cause the nails to become \\ndiscolored, thickened, distorted, and \\nbrittle. Affected nails may also cause pain \\nwhen under pressure—from shoes, for \\nexample. The toenails are affected more \\noften than the fingernails. Most fungal nail \\ninfections result from the spread of fungi \\nthat cause athlete's foot (p.229). \\nTreatment is with antifungal tablets, \\ntopical antifungal drugs, or by softening \\nthe nail and scraping away the infected \\nareas. In severe cases, removal of the nail \\nmay be recommended.\\nHEAD LICE\\nHead lice are tiny insects that live in hair \\nand lay eggs (nits) on the base of hairs. \\nHead lice are harmless, but their bite \\ncauses intense itching. They can be \\ntransmitted by close personal contact or \\nby sharing items such as combs and hats. \\nLice can be treated using over-the-\\ncounter insecticide medications. These \\nare not suitable for everybody, so a \\npharmacist should be consulted first. \\nAlternatively, lice can be removed by \\nrepeatedly combing the hair with a special \\ncomb. All family members should be \\ntreated to prevent reinfestation.\\nPARONYCHIA\\nParonychia is an infection of the fold of \\nskin surrounding a nail (the nail fold). It \\nmay develop suddenly (acute paronychia) \\ndue to a bacterial infection, or gradually \\n(chronic paronychia), usually due to a \\nyeast infection. Acute paronychia causes \\npain and swelling on the side of the nail \\nfold and a build-up of pus around the \\nnail. Chronic paronychia causes similar \\nsymptoms but does not usually produce \\na build-up of pus. \\nTreatment is with antibiotics or \\nantifungal medications. With acute \\nparonychia, it may also be necessary to \\ndrain a build-up of pus.\\nCLUBBING\\nIn clubbing, the fingertips and ends of the \\ntoes become broader, thicker, and bulbous, \\nand there is increased curvature of the nails \\nso that they look like the backside of \\nspoons. Clubbing can sometimes occur \\nwithout any apparent cause, and rarely the \\ncondition runs in families and is harmless. \\nMore commonly, however, it is a sign of an \\nunderlying disorder, such as lung cancer \\n(p.195), bronchiectasis (abnormal widening \\nof the bronchi, the large airways in the \\nlungs), cystic fibrosis (p.194), heart disease, \\nliver disease, thyroid disease, stomach \\ncancer (p.200), colon cancer (p.206), or \\ninflammatory bowel disease (p.203).\\nINGROWN TOENAIL\\nAn ingrown toenail occurs when one \\nor both edges of the nail curl under and \\ngrow into the adjacent skin. This often \\ncauses the skin to become inflamed and \\npainful. It may also bleed or become \\ninfected. Ingrown toenails are usually \\ncaused by incorrect cutting of the nails or \\nby wearing tight shoes.\\nBathing the foot regularly in a warm \\nsalt solution then covering the nail with \\na dressing may help to relieve pain. If the \\nadjacent skin is infected, antibiotics may \\nbe needed.

Five species \\nof plasmodia cause malaria, but the most \\ndangerous is \\nPlasmodium falciparum\\n, \\nwhich is responsible for most malaria-\\nrelated deaths globally and can be fatal \\nwithin about 48 hours of the first \\nsymptoms appearing if it is not treated.\\nSymptoms usually begin between about \\n7 and 18 days after being bitten by an \\ninfected mosquito, although occasionally \\nthey may not develop for a year or longer. \\nThe symptoms may include attacks of \\nMalaria carrier\\nThe malaria parasites are carried by female \\nAnopheles\\n mosquitoes, which bite mainly at dusk \\nand dawn. When an infected mosquito bites, it \\nnot only sucks up blood but also injects malaria \\nparasites into the person’s bloodstream.\\nfever, shaking, sweating, and chills. There \\nmay also be a severe headache, vomiting, \\ndiarrhea, and fatigue. In some types \\nof malaria, attacks occur in cycles, with \\nfatigue being the only symptom between \\nattacks. However, falciparum malaria \\nusually causes continuous fever, and an \\nattack may rapidly lead to unconsciousness, \\nkidney failure, or even death.\\nMalaria is treated with antimalarial \\nmedication to destroy the parasites. In \\nsevere cases, hospital treatment with \\nintravenous antimalarials, a blood \\ntransfusion, or kidney dialysis may be \\nneeded. The risk of getting malaria can \\nbe reduced by preventive antimalarial \\nmedications. However, these do not \\nprovide complete protection against \\nthe disease, so measures to avoid \\nmosquito bites are also important.\\nAMEBIASIS \\nAmebic colitis\\nAmebiasis is an intestinal infection that \\nis caused by the single-celled parasite \\nEntamoeba histolytica\\n. The infection is \\nspread by eating food or drinking water \\nthat has been contaminated by infected \\nhuman feces. \\nMany infected people do not have any \\nsymptoms, but in some cases the parasite \\ncauses amebic colitis (inflammation of the \\nintestine), which may cause symptoms \\nsuch as diarrhea and abdominal pain. \\nOccasionally, the intestine may become \\nulcerated, and amebic dysentery develops. \\nThis may cause watery, bloody diarrhea, \\nsevere abdominal pain, and sometimes \\nfever. In some cases, the infection may \\nspread to the liver and cause a liver \\nabscess, with symptoms such as fever, \\nweight loss, chills, and painful enlargement \\nof the liver.\\nTreatment of all forms of amebiasis \\nis with antibiotic medication to kill the \\nparasite. This usually leads to a full \\nrecovery. Rarely, surgery may be needed \\nto treat an amebic liver abscess. The risk of \\ninfection can be reduced by good personal \\nhygiene and by avoiding food or water \\nthat might be contaminated.\\nGIARDIASIS \\nGiardiasis is infection of the small intestine \\nwith the parasite \\nGiardia lamblia\\n. The \\ndisease is spread by drinking water or eating \\nfood contaminated with the parasite, or by \\ndirect contact with an infected person. \\nSymptoms usually start about 1 to 2 \\nweeks after infection. They may include \\ndiarrhea with foul-smelling feces, flatulence, \\nbelching, abdominal cramps, bloating, loss \\nof appetite, and nausea. If symptoms last \\nfor more than about a week, weight loss \\nand malnutrition may occur, due to \\ninsufficient nutrients being absorbed. \\nTreatment with antibiotics usually clears \\nup the infection within a few days. The \\nrisk of infection can be reduced by good \\npersonal hygiene and by avoiding food or \\nwater that might be contaminated.\\nSHIGELLOSIS \\nAlso called bacillary \\ndysentery\\n, shigellosis \\ndysentery\\n, shigellosis \\ndysentery\\nis infection of the intestine with \\nShigella\\nbacteria. The disease is spread by eating \\nfood or drinking water contaminated by \\ninfected human feces or by contact with an \\ninfected person or a contaminated surface.\\nSymptoms usually start 1 to 2 days after \\ninfection. They may include diarrhea, \\nwhich \\nmay be bloody; fever; and abdominal \\npain. \\nPersistent diarrhea may cause dehydration. \\nShigellosis usually clears up by itself in \\nabout a week. Plenty of fluids should be \\ndrunk to avoid dehydration, and \\nacetaminophen can relieve pain and fever. \\nIn severe cases, antibiotics may be necessary. \\nThe risk of infection can be reduced by \\ngood personal hygiene and avoiding food \\nor\\n water that might be contaminated.\\ndisease causes diarrhea, abdominal \\npain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. \\nSymptoms usually last about 1 to 2 \\nweeks, and most otherwise healthy \\npeople make a full recovery without \\ntreatment. However, in people with \\nimpaired immunity, such as those with \\nAIDS (p.188), the infection may be more \\nsevere and require hospitalization.'),\n",

Some infestations result from \\nworm larvae penetrating the skin, as with \\nhookworm or from bites from infected \\ninsects, as with filariasis. \\nMany roundworms primarily infect the \\nintestine; examples include hookworms \\nand pinworms. Often, these cause no \\nsymptoms or only mild ones, such as \\nabdominal pain and diarrhea. Some \\nroundworms primarily affect parts other \\nthan the intestine. For example, filariasis \\nmainly affects the lymphatic system and \\ncan lead to elephantiasis (massive swelling \\nof the legs or scrotum). Treatment of \\nroundworm infestation is with anthelmintic \\nmedication to kill the worms.\\nTAPEWORM INFESTATION \\nTapeworms are ribbon-shaped parasitic \\nworms that can infest humans and animals. \\nInfestation usually occurs by eating \\nundercooked meat or fish that contains \\ntapeworm eggs or larvae, although it \\nmay also occur by transferring worm \\neggs from the fingers to the mouth. In \\nthe intestine, the eggs and larvae mature \\ninto adult tapeworms. The adults produce \\nlarge numbers of eggs, which are passed \\nout in bowel movements and may be \\nvisible in the feces. \\nTapeworms from beef, pork, and \\nfish usually cause only mild abdominal \\ndiscomfort or diarrhea. Rarely, fish \\ntapeworms may cause anemia (p.186). \\nHowever, ingesting pork tapeworm eggs \\nmay lead to the formation of cysts in \\nbody tissues. This condition, called \\ncysticercosis, may cause symptoms such \\nas muscle pain, seizures (fits), and blindness. \\nTapeworm larvae acquired from dogs or \\nsheep may rarely lead to hydatid cysts \\n(Echinococcosis) in body organs. \\nTreatment of tapeworm infestation \\nis with anthelmintic medication, which \\nkills the worms.\\nPork tapeworm \\nThe adult pork tapeworm has suckers and \\nhooks on its head, which it uses to attach \\nitself to the wall of the intestine, where it \\nmay grow to 20–30\\nft (6–9\\n m) in length.\\nHYDATID CYST (ECHINOCOCCOSIS)\\nHydatid cysts result from infestation with \\neggs of the tapeworm \\nEchinococcus \\ngranulosus\\n. The tapeworm is found mainly \\nin sheep and dogs and may be passed \\nto humans by ingesting food or drink \\ncontaminated with infected sheep \\nor dog feces. \\nIn humans, the eggs hatch into larvae \\nin the intestine and migrate to the liver, \\nlungs, or other tissues, where they develop \\ninto cysts. The cysts grow slowly and often \\nproduce no symptoms. If symptoms \\ndo develop, they vary according to the \\nsite of the cyst. For example, a liver cyst \\nmay cause pain, nausea, and jaundice \\n(p.201); a lung cyst may cause chest pain \\nand a cough.\\nTreatment is with anthelmintic \\nmedication to kill the larvae and, in \\nmany cases, surgery to remove the cysts.\\nYEAST INFECTION \\nYeast infection (also called candidiasis) is \\nan infection caused by the yeast \\nCandida\\n. \\nThe yeast is normally present in the body \\nwithout causing problems, but sometimes it \\nmay multiply excessively and cause disease. \\nFactors that may lead to yeast overgrowth \\ninclude use of antibiotic medication or oral \\ncontraceptives, hormonal changes during \\npregnancy, disorders such as diabetes, and \\nreduced immunity. \\nSymptoms vary according to the area \\naffected. Skin infections typically cause an \\nitchy rash. Oral yeast infection produces \\nsore, creamy-yellow patches in the mouth. \\nVaginal yeast infection causes itching of the \\nvulva and vagina, a thick, white discharge, \\nand pain when urinating. In men, the penis \\nmay be affected, causing a rash and itching \\nor burning under the foreskin. Treatment is \\nwith antifungal medication to kill the yeast.\\nFLUKE INFESTATIONS \\nFlukes are flattened worms that may infest \\nhumans or animals. In humans, the two \\nmain diseases are liver fluke infestation \\n(fascioliasis) and schistosomiasis (also \\ncalled bilharzia). \\nFascioliasis is typically acquired by \\neating food contaminated with fluke \\nlarvae. In the body, the larvae invade the \\nliver, causing symptoms such as fever and \\nnight sweats. The larvae mature into adults \\nin the liver, where they may cause \\ninflammation or obstruction of the bile \\nducts, which may lead to jaundice.\\nSchistosomiasis is usually acquired by \\nbathing in water contaminated with fluke \\nlarvae. The larvae penetrate the skin and \\ndevelop into adults, which settle in veins \\nof the bladder and intestines, causing \\ninflammation and sometimes bleeding and \\nulceration. Eggs produced by the adults may \\nmigrate to the liver and cause liver damage. \\nSymptoms of schistosomiasis include \\nitching where larvae penetrated the skin; \\nfever; muscle pain; diarrhea; frequent, \\npainful urination; blood in the urine; and \\na cough. Treatment of both diseases is with \\nanthelmintic medication to kill the flukes.'),\n",

Alcohol is \\nbroken down in the body by the liver, \\nbut the liver can only break down a \\nlimited amount at any given time. When \\nlarge amounts are drunk quickly, the \\nalcohol concentration in the body rapidly \\nrises to toxic levels. This can produce \\nsymptoms such as confusion, slurred \\nspeech, loss of coordination, vomiting, \\nirregular breathing, low body \\ntemperature, and unconsciousness. \\nThere is also a danger that the person \\nmay choke on their own vomit. \\nSevere poisoning may cause seizures, \\na heart attack (myocardial infarction), \\nbrain damage, and breathing stoppage \\n(respiratory arrest), and may be life-\\nthreatening.

Frostnip does not cause permanent \\ndamage, but it may develop into frostbite \\nif exposure to cold continues. \\nIn frostbite, the affected area becomes \\nwhite, cold, and hard; it may then become \\nred and swollen. When rewarmed, mildly \\naffected tissues become red, swollen, and \\nsore. In more severe cases, blisters develop \\nand the area becomes very painful. Severe \\nfrostbite may lead to gangrene (tissue \\ndeath) or longer-term problems, such as \\npersistent pain or loss of sensation.\\nANIMAL BITES AND STINGS\\nThe effects of a bite or sting vary, \\ndepending on whether the animal is \\nvenomous, whether it transmits disease, \\nand the amount of tissue damage. A \\nminor, nonvenomous bite or sting typically \\ncauses only temporary pain and swelling. \\nHowever, medical attention should be \\nsought if symptoms are severe, do not \\nsubside, other symptoms develop, or \\nthe animal may carry a disease such \\nas malaria (p.237) or rabies (a viral \\ninfection that affects the nervous system). \\nSome people have a life-threatening \\nallergic reaction (called anaphylaxis), \\nwhich requires urgent medical help.

The first comprises paranoid, \\nschizoid, and schizotypal personalities. \\nPeople in this group have patterns of \\nbehavior and thinking that most would see \\nas eccentric or odd. The second group \\nconsists of antisocial, histrionic, narcissistic, \\nor borderline personality types. This \\ngroup is typified by emotional, impulsive, \\nattention-seeking, or self-centered \\nbehavior. The third group comprises \\navoidant, dependent, or obsessive-\\ncompulsive personalities. People in this \\ngroup have anxious, fearful, or inhibited \\npatterns of thinking and behavior. \\nTreatment usually involves psychotherapy \\nand support to help the person adapt his or \\nher behavior and function successfully. The \\noutlook is variable, although generally the \\nmanifestations of a dysfunctional \\npersonality diminish with age.\\nOBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE \\nDISORDER\\nCommonly known as OCD, obsessive-\\ncompulsive disorder is characterized by \\nuncontrollable, persistent thoughts \\n(obsessions) accompanied by irresistible \\nurges to carry out particular actions or \\nrituals (compulsions). \\nObsessions are unwanted thoughts, \\nimages, or feelings that enter the mind \\nrepeatedly and cause disturbing feelings of \\nanxiety or disgust. A person with OCD may \\nrecognize that the obsessions are irrational \\nbut is unable to ignore them.\\nCompulsions are repetitive behaviors or \\nmental acts that the person feels driven to \\nperform to relieve the disturbing feelings \\ncaused by the obsession. The compulsive \\nacts (repetitive handwashing, for example) \\nmay have to be carried out so many times \\nthat they seriously disrupt normal life. \\nMild OCD can often be successfully \\ntreated with psychotherapy. In more \\nsevere cases, psychotherapy and \\nantidepressant medication may be used. \\nMost people improve within about a year \\nof starting treatment, but for a minority \\nOCD may persist long-term.\\nADHD\\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder \\n(ADHD) is a behavioral problem in \\nchildren in which there is a consistently \\nhigh level of activity, impulsiveness, and \\ndifficulty attending to tasks. The cause \\nis unknown, although the disorder tends \\nto run in families, so a genetic factor may \\nbe involved. \\nSymptoms usually develop between \\nabout the ages of 3 and 7 years. They may \\ninclude a short attention span; an inability \\nto finish tasks; difficulty in following \\ninstructions; a tendency to talk excessively \\nand interrupt others; difficulty waiting or \\ntaking turns; constant fidgeting; an inability \\nto play quietly alone; and frequently acting \\nwithout thinking. \\nTreatment may be with therapy, \\nmedication, or both. Therapy may involve \\npsychotherapy and social skills training, as \\nwell as training and education for parents. \\nMedications can help to control the \\nsymptoms—for example, by aiding \\nconcentration and reducing impulsiveness. \\nSymptoms of ADHD usually diminish with \\ntime, although the condition may \\nsometimes persist into adulthood.\\nDEPRESSION\\nPostnatal depression  |  Seasonal affective \\ndisorder (SAD)      \\nDepression is characterized by persistent \\nfeelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss \\nof interest in life.

They include \\nphysical tics, such as facial twitches, \\nblinking, mouth movements, and head \\nand foot movements; and vocal tics, such \\nas coughing, throat clearing, snorting, and \\ngrunting. In some cases, the person may \\nrepeatedly utter obscenities, copy what \\nother people say or do, say the same thing \\nrepeatedly, or make complex physical \\nmovements (such as jumping or hitting \\nthemselves or others).\\nTreatment is usually with psychotherapy. \\nMedication to control the tics may also be \\nused. For most people, the condition is \\nlifelong, although the symptoms tend to \\nbecome less severe with age and may \\neventually disappear completely.\\nSUBSTANCE MISUSE\\nAlcohol/drug misuse      \\nSubstance misuse is the harmful use of \\nalcohol, drugs (including prescription and \\nover-the-counter medications), or other \\nchemicals, such as inhalants. \\nCommonly misused substances include \\nalcohol, cannabis, heroin, cocaine, \\namphetamines, benzodiazepines, \\nhallucinogens, and various “designer \\ndrugs.” Usually, they are used to cause \\nintoxication or alter mood. However, \\nexcessive amounts can be dangerous in \\nthe short term. For example, drinking large \\namounts of alcohol in a short period may \\ncause confusion, loss of memory, or, in \\nextreme cases, death. Similarly, a drug \\noverdose may be fatal. In the longer term, \\nregular use of a substance may lead to \\ntolerance (in which increasing amounts are \\nneeded to achieve the desired effect) and \\naddiction. It may also cause organ damage; \\nmental health problems; and disruption of \\nfamily, social, and work life.\\nAcid-worn teeth in bulimia\\nRecurrent vomiting in bulimia causes the teeth \\nto be exposed repeatedly to stomach acid. This \\nwears away the enamel covering the teeth and \\nmay eventually lead to tooth decay.\\nEATING DISORDERS\\nAnorexia nervosa      \\nEating disorders are characterized by an \\nabnormal attitude to food, resulting in \\navoiding food (anorexia), self-induced \\nvomiting (bulimia), or compulsive \\novereating (binge eating disorder).  \\nPeople with anorexia believe themselves \\nto be fat even when they are underweight. \\nAs well as severely restricting calorie \\nintake, affected people may exercise \\nexcessively, use appetite suppressants or \\nlaxatives, or make themselves vomit after \\neating. Menstrual periods may stop; fine, \\ndowny hair grows on the body; and the \\nbody muscles waste away. Eventually, \\nanorexia can be life-threatening. \\nIn bulimia, the person binge eats, then \\ndeliberately vomits or uses laxatives to \\navoid weight gain. Vomiting may cause \\nchemical imbalances in the blood, which \\nmay lead to irregular heart rhythms. \\nIn binge eating disorder, the person feels \\ncompelled to eat large amounts in a short \\nperiod, even when he or she is not hungry, \\nwhich often leads to obesity.\\nTreatment of an eating disorder usually \\ninvolves psychotherapy and nutritional \\nguidance; antidepressants may also be \\nprescribed. Recovery may take a long time, \\nsometimes years.\\nOnline gambling\\nCompulsive gambling can jeopardize many \\naspects of a person’s social, work, and family \\nlife, as well as causing financial problems. The \\navailability of online gambling may make it \\nharder for a person addicted to gambling to stop. \\nADDICTIONS\\nAn addiction is a state of being so \\ndependent on something that it is difficult \\nor impossible to do without it for any \\nsignificant period. It is possible to become \\naddicted to anything, but whatever the \\naddiction is, the person cannot control it. \\nSome symptoms are specific to the \\naddictive substance or activity, but there \\nare general features that occur in all \\naddictions. These include the development \\nof tolerance—the need for increasing \\namounts to produce the desired effect; \\nunpleasant physical and psychological \\nsymptoms when the substance or activity \\nis stopped; and continuing to use the \\nsubstance or engage in the activity even \\nthough it may be detrimental. \\nTreatment of addictions depends on the \\nspecific substance or activity involved. In \\ngeneral, however, it may include support \\nfrom family, friends, and self-help groups \\nwhile reducing use of the substance or the \\nactivity, and psychotherapy. Medication \\nmay also sometimes be prescribed—for \\nexample, to reduce withdrawal symptoms \\nin drug or alcohol addiction. In some \\ncases, treatment in a specialist rehabilitation \\ncenter may be recommended.'),\n",
